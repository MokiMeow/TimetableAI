# AI-based College Timetable Generator using OpenAI/Gemini, Next.js, and MongoDB

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-based timetable generator for college schedules, leveraging OpenAI or Gemini for AI capabilities, Next.js for the web application, and MongoDB for data storage.

## Key Variables and Constraints
[This section remains the same as in the previous version]

## Tech Stack and Tools

1. AI Service: OpenAI API or Gemini API for natural language processing and AI-driven timetable generation
2. Next.js: React framework for building the web application (both frontend and backend)
3. MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing timetable data and constraints
4. Node.js: JavaScript runtime for the server-side environment
5. TypeScript: For type-safe JavaScript development
6. Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js
7. Vercel: For easy deployment and hosting of the Next.js application

## Key Components

1. `pages/api/generate-timetable.ts`: API route for timetable generation
2. `lib/ai-service.ts`: Interface for communicating with OpenAI or Gemini API
3. `lib/mongodb.ts`: MongoDB connection and configuration
4. `models/`: Mongoose models for courses, faculty, classrooms, etc.
5. `components/TimetableGenerator.tsx`: Main component for timetable generation interface
6. `utils/timetable-algorithm.ts`: Core logic for timetable generation

## AI Integration

1. Use OpenAI's GPT models or Gemini for natural language understanding and generation.
2. Implement prompts for the AI to assist in timetable generation based on given constraints.
3. Use the AI to optimize timetables and resolve conflicts.

## Development Workflow

1. Set up the Next.js project with TypeScript and MongoDB integration.
2. Implement MongoDB models for storing timetable-related data.
3. Create API routes for CRUD operations and timetable generation.
4. Develop the frontend components for user input and timetable display.
5. Integrate the chosen AI service (OpenAI or Gemini) for timetable generation and optimization.
6. Implement the core timetable generation algorithm, leveraging AI assistance.
7. Add authentication and authorization for secure access to the application.

## Improvement Areas

1. AI-Driven Insights: Use the AI to provide insights on timetable efficiency and suggest improvements.
2. Natural Language Interface: Implement a chatbot interface for users to query and modify timetables using natural language.
3. Real-time Collaboration: Add features for multiple users to work on timetables simultaneously.
4. Mobile Responsiveness: Ensure the application works well on various devices.
5. Performance Optimization: Implement caching and optimize database queries for faster timetable generation.
6. Customizable Constraints: Allow administrators to define custom constraints for their institution.
7. Integration with College Systems: Develop APIs to integrate with existing college management systems.
8. Advanced Visualization: Implement interactive and customizable timetable views.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables in `.env.local`:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   # or
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   ```
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Deployment

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables in Vercel
3. Deploy the application with `git push` to your main branch
